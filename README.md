Django on OpenShift
===================

This git repository helps you get up and running quickly w/ a Django installation
on OpenShift Express.  The Django project name used in this repo is 'osqa'
but you can feel free to change it.  Right now the backend is sqlite3 and the
database runtime is @ $OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR/sqlite3.db.

When you push this application up for the first time, the sqlite database is
copied from wsgi/osqa/sqlite3.db.  This is the stock database that is created
when 'python manage.py syncdb' is run with only the admin app installed.

You can delete the database from your git repo after the first push (you probably
should for security).  On subsequent pushes, a 'python manage.py syncdb' is
executed to make sure that any models you added are created in the DB.  If you
do anything that requires an alter table, you could add the alter statements
in GIT_ROOT/.openshift/action_hooks/alter.sql and then use
GIT_ROOT/.openshift/action_hooks/deploy to execute that script (make sure to
back up your database w/ rhc-snapshot first :) )


Running on OpenShift
----------------------------

Create an account at http://openshift.redhat.com/ , don't forget to create a namespace and install client tools as well. And ensure you have 'django', 'mysql', 'mysql-devel', 'mysql-python' installed on your local machine.

Create a python application

    rhc app create -a osqa -t python-2.6

Add this upstream seambooking repo

    cd osqa
    git remote add upstream -m master git@github.com:lulinqing/OSQA-mysql.git
    git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master

Add mysql database support for you app

    rhc app cartridge add -a osqa -c mysql-5.1

You will get some useful information from the output.

Update the "wsgi/osqa/settings_local.py" config file with the information you just got

    cd wsgi/osqa
    vi settings_local.py

    Then update following parameters:
        DATABASE_NAME = 'osqa'        # usually the same name as your app
        DATABASE_PASSWORD = 'xxxxxxxxxx'    # replace it with your password
        DATABASE_HOST = '127.xx.xx.xx'       # replace it with IP of your
        APP_URL = 'http://osqa-$yournamespace.rhcloud.com'      # replace it with your app URL

    git commit -a -m ' update settings_local.py'

Forwarding remote mysql service port to your local machine, we will need this for step 7 (better use another terminal window)

    rhc-port-forward -a osqa

Prepare your mysql database for app

    ./manage.py syncdb --all

Choose 'no' when being asked whether create an account now.

    ./manage.py migrate forum --fake

You can push the repo now

    git push

That's it, you can now checkout your application at:

    http://osqa-$yournamespace.rhcloud.com
